/# AI Problems Benchmark — Streamlit

A Streamlit web interface for generating problem instances (N-Queens, Generalized Hanoi, Graph Coloring, Knight's Tour), applying prefill, and benchmarking multiple search/informed algorithms shipped in this workspace.

## Quick Start

1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

3. In the sidebar, choose a problem and parameters, set prefill level, then generate an instance. Run the benchmark and select your algorithm guess to see your score.
